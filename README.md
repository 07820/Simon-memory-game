# Simon-memory-game

This game is a multiplayer memory challenge game. Players need to remember the sequence of colored buttons (red, yellow, blue, green) shown by the game and then click the corresponding buttons in the same order. At the start of the game, players can choose between single-player mode or multiplayer mode. In multiplayer mode, players take turns playing, and with each round, the difficulty increases as the sequence lengthens. After each player completes their turn, the system records their score and displays the final ranking.
